This whole concept is awesome. I quote:
> Red Pen lets you upload your design, share a short URL, and get live, annotated feedback super-fast.  

This is how it works: you go to [RedPen.io](http://redpen.io) and upload your image. You'll receive a personalized URL, in short format, like [http://redpen.io/ng7h1f](http://redpen.io/ng7h1f). You're then invited to fill your name and e-mail address, so the system remembers you (click to see full image, its width is too high compared to its height to be properly show here):  
  
<p class="centeredImage"><a class="img" href="/assets/redPen/registerBig.png"><img src="/assets/redPen/register.png" alt="Register Bar"></a></p>
  
From second visit onwards the bar looks like this (click for the same reason as above):  
  
<p class="centeredImage"><a class="img" href="/assets/redPen/registeredBig.png"><img src="/assets/redPen/registered.png" alt="Registered Bar"></a></p>

You can then start sending it to people you'd like an opinion from. To leave a comment you just tap on the image, preferably on the exact spot/area you want to comment on, because a red dot appears where you click:  
  
<p class="centeredImage"><img src="/assets/redPen/dotPlacement.png" alt="RedPen Dot Placement"></p>

Hovering the image reveals all entry points (dots) for existing comments (or threads if you prefer this naming):  
  
<p class="centeredImage"><img src="/assets/redPen/severalPoints.png" alt="RedPen Dot Placement Example"></p>
If you keep your link open somewhere, you'll even receive live notifications every time a new comment is added:  
  
<p class="centeredImage"><img src="/assets/redPen/notification.png" alt="Notification""></p>
Hovering a dot opens a popup with all comments in that spot, allowing you to reply to that particular thread:  

<p class="centeredImage"><img src="/assets/redPen/replyCascade.png" alt="RedPen Reply Example"></p> 
  
Go ahead and give it a try, it's pretty awesome, if you ask me.
