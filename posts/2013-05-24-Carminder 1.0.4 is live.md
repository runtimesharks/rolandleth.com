This version brings:  
• Badge count. You can now set the badge on the app icon for the number of events, as follows: tomorrow, within two weeks, within a month, all and none.  
• Finally fixed all the bugs preventing the keyboard to hide on the iPad.  
• Fixed a bug I introduced in last version where the keyboard would sometimes not hide on the iPhone.  
• Changed the name in the App Store.  
• Minor overall tweaks.
