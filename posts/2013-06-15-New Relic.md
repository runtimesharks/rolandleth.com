Today I installed their standard Heroku add-on and, after only half a day of usage, I'm blown away. Here's what you get for free:

* App Response Time, Throughput & Breakdown by Component
* Real-User Response Time, Throughput & Breakdown by Layer
* Server Resource and Availability Monitoring
* App Availability Monitoring, Alerting, and Notification (bye, bye Pingdom) 
* Error Detection, Alerting, & Analysis
* Awesome graphs
* Full list [here](http://newrelic.com/pricing/details).

The amount of information it can gather is impressive, and it can be installed on any platform, even mobile apps. I think it's worth checking it out.  
[Here](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/attention-developers-newrelic-is-your-secret-weapon/) is a pretty detailed review by net.tutsplus.

Oh, did I mention their support is **awesome**? I received replies in under an hour, four times in a row; for quite unimportant stuff too.

On a side note, I finally configured syntax highlighting; awesome.
