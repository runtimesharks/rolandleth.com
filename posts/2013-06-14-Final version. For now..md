blog

Finally took the time to recreate the blog with [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), just as I wanted. The WordPress theme i was using was highly customized, but wasn't really fitting my needs anymore. And, again, since I'm learning web development, why not redesign it completely?  
  
The site was created with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), and it's hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). I'm still using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Mou](http://mouapp.com) to write, but instead of using a database for the posts, I'm using `.md` files; this way I have them on the server git, on my Mac (and on Time Machine, implicitly) **and** synced with Dropbox, since I will be using [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) for mobile editing.
  
The only thing I will miss is publishing from mobile, since I don't have a way to push the files to the server when mobile, nor do I know how to read straight from Dropbox; but I'll get to that too, eventually.

I'm *really* happy with the result!
