blog

The most obvious thing is that I started writing this blog; that's an addition to what I had so far. What did change are my app pages: instead of having them under <code>rolandleth.com/appname</code>, I moved them to <code>appname.rolandleth.com</code>, so I can tweak them separately and build landing pages for them.

I used the free WordPress theme created by the great guys at [Apptamin](http://apptamin.com), theme found on [GitHub](https://github.com/apptamin/apptamin-a). I also tweaked it to be used for apps/games in landscape, I moved some functions around that were creating a weird " " text, which in turn was creating a weird blank space and the result is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rolandleth/apptamin-a); to be used with screenshots that have their own iPhone/iPod frames, not the included ones. This means in your WordPress Dashboard, in Appearance, under Apptamin Theme Options you need to set the <i>Front Device</i> and the _Back Device_ to *None* under AppStage and for **all** the features you want to add under App Features.

My tweaked version works with portrait as well, but requires a bit more tweaking with positioning. Shouldn't be hard in case you want to use screenshots with frame included.
