What's new in this Version:  
• Autocomplete suggestions! The app comes with a list of autocomplete suggestions for events, which updates itself dynamically when adding new ones: if the event doesn't exist in the list, it is added. You can delete suggestions by going to Settings -> Autocomplete.   
• Other minor UI tweaks.
