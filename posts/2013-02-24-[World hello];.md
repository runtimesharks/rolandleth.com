blog

Welcome to my blog.  
  
I thought it's about time I should start writing, but to be **totally** honest, that time has passed for quite some time now, so I should rephrase that to: *I thought it's too damn long since I should have started writing*.  
  
I will be writing mostly about iOS development. I'll post snippets, walkthroughs, tips and tricks, stuff that I struggled with and links to interesting stuff I find around the web.  

The blog is running on [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) and it's written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with the help of [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) and sometimes [Poster](http://www.tomwitkin.com/poster/).

*Thanks for visiting!*

Update Mar 22, 2013: Today I downloaded [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com). Since it has great Markdown support, I think I will be replacing Mou to write my posts on the Mac. I'm just sad it has no *copy as HTML*. Don't really need it, but would have been nice.
For mobile I'll keep on using Poster, don't think it can better than this.

Update Jun 15, 2013: Completely ditched WordPress and recreated the blog with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). Read more about it [here](/Final-version.-For-now.). Also, the live preview and, most of all, the custom-css for Mou's preview beats any Markdown editor.
