Since I started learning web development/design, what better place to start than to replicate my apps' landing pages so I can bring them all back under `rolandleth.com`?  
They were moved under `appname.rolandleth.com` so I could use a full blown wordpress theme, but no need any longer.  
I'm pretty pleased by the result, everything under the same roof again.   
As it should! :)  
  
I will be posting the source on [Github](http://github.com/rolandleth) as soon as I finish cleaning the  
files up.  Update: [here](https://github.com/rolandleth/RLLandingPage)'s the repo.
