Awesome app for previewing app icons directly on your device. Easy, seamless integration with your Mac: drag and drop an image to the menubar icon, and, bam, it's on the device. The Mac companion app is free and can be found on the Mac App Store [here](http://bpxl.me/13BfzAb).

The only caveat is that you can only preview one icon at a time. I ==really== hope they will add the possibility to add several icons (grid or even scroll based) so you can be able to compare several iterations at once.

Otherwise, **amazing** app. You can find the app [here](http://ikonica.me); via [BeautifulPixels](http://beautifulpixels.com/macintosh/easily-preview-your-ios-icons-on-the-device-with-ikonica/).
