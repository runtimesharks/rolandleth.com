Really nice utility class to modify the frame of an UIView. Semantically and without the multitude of CGRectMakes, using more readable stuff like:  
<pre>`[view.po_frameBuilder setWidth:100.0f height:40.0f]`</pre>
You can find the class on his [GitHub](https://github.com/podio/ios-view-frame-builder) and read about it [on his blog](http://sebreh.tumblr.com/post/36673388038/drop-the-layout-magic).

*Thanks, Sebastian!*
