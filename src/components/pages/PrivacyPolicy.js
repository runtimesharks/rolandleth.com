			<h1>Collected information</h1>
			<p>
				I do not use technologies like web beacons, or unique device
				identifiers. My systems do log information like your browser,
				operating system and device type.
			</p>
			<p />
			<p>
				I do not collect personally identifiable information about you. In
				other words, I do not collect information such as your name,
				address, phone number or email address.
			</p>
			<p />
			<p>
				Following{" "}
				<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en">
					their documentation
				</a>
				, Google Analytics is configured to anonymize your IP, meaning it
				can not be linked to you. This also means that only your approximate
				geographical location is known; I have no interest in this data, but
				it can not be configured in another way, or I would have. This
				information is not stored anywhere, it's only used by Google
				Analytics to display visitor traffic based on location.
			</p>
			<p>
				Google Analytics is also configured to use a cookie that uniquely
				and anonymously identifies your <em>browser</em>; it is not linked
				in any way with you or any other personally identifiable
				information. The single purpose of this cookie is for knowing how
				many users are visiting my blog and the most visited pages, so I can
				better understand what to write about. I explicitly named this
				cookie <code>Google Analytics Cookie</code>, as to be easy to spot;
				it expires in 2 years. There's also a <code>_gid</code> version of
				this cookie that has the same purpose, but expires in 24 hours. More
				info can be found{" "}
				<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">
					here

				. Detailed guides on how to delete or disable cookies from your

				I do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from
				children under 13. If you believe I have inadvertently collected
				such information, please contact me so I can promptly obtain
				parental consent or remove the information.
			</p>

			<p />
			<h1>Sharing</h1>
			<p>
				Since I do not collect personally identifiable information (such as
				name, address, email or phone), I never share them with other
				companies.
			</p>
			<p />
			<p>
				In order to serve you, I may share your anonymous information with
				other companies, excluding vendors and contractors. Their use of
				information is limited to these purposes, and subject to agreements
				that require them to keep the information confidential. They provide
				assurance that they take reasonable steps to safeguard the data they
				hold on my behalf, although data security cannot be guaranteed.

			<h1>Analytics</h1>

				Analytics companies may get access to anonymous data to help me
				understand how my services are used. They use this data solely on my
				behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is

			<h1>Third parties</h1>
			<p>
				To operate the service, I also may make anonymous information
				available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with
				your express consent, (2) when I have a good faith belief it is
				required by law, (3) when I have a good faith belief it is necessary
				to protect my rights or property, or (4) to any successor or
				purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale
				of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these
				cases, but I will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by
				law to do so.
