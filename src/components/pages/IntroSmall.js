			<Greeting>Hi, I'm Roland Leth</Greeting>
			<p>
				I’m an iOS developer since 2011, with extensive full-stack knowledge and
				highly focused on user experience. I'm also an entrepreneur, amateur
				designer and occasional blogger. There used to be a blog here and
				everything is still there and directly accesisble, it's just that I
				don't really write anymore.
			</p>
