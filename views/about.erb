	    Hello, my name is Roland; I’m an iOS developer and an amateur web developer & designer.
	    I finished learning Ruby a while ago and I’m currently making great progress through Rails.
	    More detailed information can be found in <a href="/files/Roland Leth.pdf">my résumé</a>.

	  You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/rolandleth">@rolandleth</a> and on App.net also <a href="https://alpha.app.net/rolandleth">@rolandleth</a>. If you want to hire or work with me, need help, or just want to say hi, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:rolandleth@me.com">rolandleth@me.com</a>.

	  I’m writing mostly about iOS development: snippets, walkthroughs, tips and tricks, stuff that I struggled with and links to interesting stuff I find around the web. From time to time I will find an interesting or helpful app and I will write about that, as well.
