	    Hello, my name is Roland; I’m an iOS developer and an amateur web developer & designer. I just finished learning
	    Ruby and I’m currently progressing through Rails. <a href="/files/Roland Leth.pdf">Here</a> is my
	    résumé.

	  You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/rolandleth">@rolandleth</a> and on App.net also <a href="https://alpha.app.net/rolandleth">@rolandleth</a>. If you want to hire or work with me, need help, or just want to say hi, you can drop me an email at <a href="mailto:rolandleth@me.com">rolandleth@me.com</a>.

	  <p>
	  I’m writing mostly about iOS development: snippets, walkthroughs, tips and tricks, stuff that I struggled with and links to interesting stuff I find around the web. From time to time I will find an interesting or helpful app and I will write about that, as well.
