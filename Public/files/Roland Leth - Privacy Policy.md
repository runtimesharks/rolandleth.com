I do not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, I do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address.

I do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe I have inadvertently collected such information, please contact me so I can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.
